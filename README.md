# Android-Studio-Contacts
The project is an Android Studio project. It allows the user to create, delete, and view contact objects containing names, emails, and phone numbers. The app provides a user friendly interface which contains a menu containing a view button and an add button. The view button allows the user to view their contacts as a page view and swipe left or right in order to traverse through them. The contacts are stored using an SQLite Database which allows the user to store long term information. This allows the user to view their contact list even after opening and closing the app.
